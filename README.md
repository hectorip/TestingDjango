# Learning Django, seriously

I've worked with python like animals do.

I've learned Python in the wild with no previous or formal preparation on the language, 
and I've started programming for the web in Python with this very little serious of formal prepartion.

Later, I've read some reosurces on Python to train me in it. Then I started working in Django even
without reading the introductory tutorial programming the projects and searching for the answers 
in Google (almost always I ended in StackOverflow).

I think it's time to me to study some formal and well planned resources about how to code Django the right way.

The resources I will be using are:

- [The official tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/intro/tutorial01/)
- [Obbey the testing Goat! (TDD with Python)](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/pages/book.html#toc)
- [Two Scoops of Django](https://www.twoscoopspress.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-11)
