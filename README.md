# Learning Django, seriously

I've been working with python like animals do.

I've learned Python in the wild with no previous or formal preparation on the language (although I already knew 
how to program in another languages), and I've started programming for the web in Python with this very little prepartion.

Later, I've read some reosurces on Python to train me in it. Then I started working in Django even
without reading the introductory tutorial, programming the projects and searching for the answers 
in Google (I ended almost always in StackOverflow).

I think it's time to me to study some formal and well planned resources about how to code Django the right way.

The resources I will be using are:

1. [The official tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/intro/tutorial01/). This is the basic reource for learning 
Django, it teaches all you need to start developing full-fledged applications in Django. It assumes you already know about web development and Python.
2. [Obbey the testing Goat! (TDD with Python)](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/pages/book.html#toc). It teaaches everything you need to know about two important subjects: testing and doing it with Python/Django. It's a very entretaining and insightful book that not only teaches important things about programming, but also about testing in the web environment.
3. [Two Scoops of Django](https://www.twoscoopspress.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-11). This book shows you everything you know to need about developing real world and scalable applications in Django. It's written by a practicing professional that contributes to the Django community. It costs ~$826 MXN, but it worths every penny.

Also if you feel you need more preparation in python itself I could recommend you a few resources:

1. [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/). Is a free book with a paid option you could use to learn and ingrain the basics of the language.
